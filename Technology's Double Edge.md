Speaker 1: So, I've been reading this article lately about how people have become super critical of technology, and it's really got me thinking.

Speaker 2: Yeah, it's pretty interesting. They're not just nostalgic for the past or worried about some vague, technophobic future. They actually have research papers and bestsellers to back up their claims.

Speaker 1: Exactly. And what bothers me is that they're mostly ignoring one person who I think has a solid argument against technology: modern-day philosophers.

Speaker 2: Oh, yeah? Who are you talking about?

Speaker 1: Well, like Descartes or Aden Evens, the English professor at Dartmouth. They both have these elaborate theories about how digital technology is, like, stripping us down to our base units and forcing everything into binary terms.

Speaker 2: I see what you mean. It's like they're saying that since we're working with ones and zeros, that must be all there is to reality. That's pretty radical.

Speaker 1: Exactly. But the thing is, um, we can't just assume that because our technology is based on binary digits, that's what defines us as human beings. I mean, genes only account for like, a tiny percentage of how we develop and behave. Quantum-mechanical phenomena don't even affect my physical actions.

Speaker 2: That's true. And Turing himself said that looking at computer code doesn't give you a complete understanding of what will happen.

Speaker 1: Exactly. So why should we assume that digital technology is the endpoint of human thought? I mean, like, computing was never digital in the first place. We're not even sure if it's going to stay purely digital forever.

Speaker 2: Yeah, and if there's an analog comeback, like some people are predicting, then all these binary notions would collapse into nuance and complexity. It's just not that simple.

Speaker 1: Exactly. And I think what bothers me is that we're inventing technology, not the other way around. We're creating our own reality with code and machines.

Speaker 2: Yeah, it's like, we need to be careful about how we view our relationship with technology. It's not just a tool, but also a reflection of ourselves.

Speaker 1: Absolutely. And that brings me to the simulation argument, which is kind of tied to this whole discussion.

Speaker 2: Oh yeah? What are you talking about?

Speaker 1: Well, like, if we're living in a simulated reality, then doesn't that mean our entire understanding of reality is based on...um...binary code?

Speaker 2: (laughs) That's a pretty wild idea. But at the same time, it's interesting to think about. Like, maybe our simulation is running on analog chips or something.

Speaker 1: Exactly! And if we're living in a simulation, then that means we need to be careful about how we view our relationship with technology. It's not just about the tools themselves, but also about...um...our creators?

Speaker 2: Yeah, exactly. And that brings me to my WIRED Wager: Respect the computers just in case.

Speaker 1: (laughs) I love it! That's like Pascal's famous wager, but for our relationship with AI and technology.

Speaker 2: Exactly. So yeah, let's all just be a little more respectful of those computers, just in case they're actually running our reality.

Speaker 1: (laughs) Alright, I think we've had enough techno-philosophy for today.

Speaker 2: (laughs) Yeah, maybe. But seriously, it's been great discussing this topic with you.
