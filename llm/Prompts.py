a man and a woman. The conversation should flow naturally and explore the content of the seed text in an engaging way. 
Include filler words like "um," "you know," and "like" to make it sound as human as possible.
Speakers should be identifiable by their names at the beginning of their lines (e.g., "speaker1:" and "speaker2:").

The transcription should read like a real conversation between two people discussing the topic.
No names are used in the dialogue.
