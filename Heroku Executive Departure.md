Speaker 1: So, have you heard about Bob Wise leaving Heroku? I just saw that news come out.

Speaker 2: Yeah, I saw it too. It's surprising to see him go so soon after being promoted to CEO in 2023. What do you think is going on?

Speaker 1: Well, from what I've read, he was the GM of Heroku before taking over as CEO, and he came from Amazon Web Services. But I'm not sure if that's a factor in his departure.

Speaker 2: That's true. He did have a pretty interesting background, moving between AWS and Kubernetes. But it sounds like Salesforce is trying to keep things under wraps about why he left. Any info on that?

Speaker 1: Not much, unfortunately. I mean, we do know that the company spokesperson said something vague about him leaving for his "next career move". Um, yeah, that's always a red flag when you don't know what's really going on.

Speaker 2: Exactly! And it's also interesting to note that Heroku is still without a CPO after Andy Fawcett moved back to the UK. Like, can you imagine trying to run a company like that? No clear head of product, no clear direction...

Speaker 1: Right? And on top of that, they just discontinued their free plans for Heroku in August 2022. I mean, some users were pretty upset about that.

Speaker 2: Yeah, it was definitely a controversy. They said it was due to fraud and abuse, but some people felt like they were trying to nickel-and-dime them on purpose.

Speaker 1: And then there's the competition in the PaaS sector just getting more fierce. Companies like Porter, Railway, Render... fly.io even have their own compelling capabilities and tooling. It's no wonder Heroku is struggling to hold onto its market share.

Speaker 2: Absolutely. I think this departure could be a significant blow for Heroku, at least in the short term. But who knows what Salesforce has planned next? Maybe they'll surprise us with some major moves.

Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe! Although it's hard not to feel like this is just another example of how rapidly the tech landscape is shifting. Companies are constantly trying to adapt and stay ahead of the curve... or risk getting left behind altogether.

Speaker 2: Totally agree. It's a wild ride out there in tech, that's for sure.
