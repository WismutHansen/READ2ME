Here is a podcast-style transcription of a conversation between two speakers:

**speaker1:** Hey there, folks! Welcome to today's episode on... well, I'm not entirely sure what we're talking about yet, but it should be interesting! (laughs) Seriously though, have you ever wondered how language models like the ones used in our research are trained?

**speaker2:** Yeah, um, I mean, it seems like they're just magic or something. But no, seriously, it's actually pretty fascinating stuff. So, we've been exploring this topic of pseudo-labels and their impact on training these language models.

**speaker1:** Pseudo-labels? Like, fake labels or something?

**speaker2:** Exactly! Yeah, pseudo-labels are essentially... well, they're not really labels at all, but rather, they're like estimates of what the true label should be. And then we use these pseudo-labels to train our models.

**speaker1:** Okay, got it. So, like, how do you create these pseudo-labels?

**speaker2:** Well, that's a great question! We can use all sorts of methods, but one common approach is to use... um, what's the word I'm thinking of? (laughs) Ah yes, semi-supervised learning!

**speaker1:** Semi-supervised learning? That sounds like a mouthful.

**speaker2:** (laughs) Yeah, it's not exactly the most exciting term, but trust me, it's really cool stuff! The idea is that we can use a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to train our models. And pseudo-labels play a big role in this process.

**speaker1:** That makes sense, I think. So, like, what are some of the benefits of using pseudo-labels?

**speaker2:** Well, one major advantage is that they can... you know, help alleviate the issue of class imbalance, where there's not enough data for certain classes. And another benefit is that they can make our models more robust to... um, what do you call it? (pauses) Ah yes, noise!

**speaker1:** Noise in the sense like, random mistakes?

**speaker2:** Exactly! Yeah, pseudo-labels can help our models learn to ignore or... I don't know, tolerate that kind of noise. And another thing is that they can be used to... you know, make the training process more efficient.

**speaker1:** Efficient? Like, it saves time or something?

**speaker2:** Yeah, exactly! Because we don't need to have all this labeled data upfront. We can just use our pseudo-labels to get started and then fine-tune later.

**speaker1:** Okay, I think I'm starting to get it. So, like, how do you know when a pseudo-label is good enough?

**speaker2:** Ah, that's the million-dollar question! (laughs) Seriously though, we have this thing called... um, threshold evaluation!

**speaker1:** Threshold evaluation? Like, where do we set the bar?

**speaker2:** Yeah, exactly! We need to figure out what value of pseudo-labels is good enough for our model. And that's where thresholds come in.

**speaker1:** Okay, I see. So, like, it's a trade-off between having really accurate labels and having... you know, less noisy data?

**speaker2:** Exactly! Yeah, we have to balance these two things. And it seems like, based on our experiments... (pauses) Oh wait, I just remembered the name of that dataset! It's called Arxiv-10!

**speaker1:** (laughs) Nice save! So, what are some of the findings from that dataset?

**speaker2:** Well, um... actually, I think we might have a few surprises up our sleeve. (pauses for dramatic effect)

**speaker1:** (excitedly) Ooh, tell us!

**speaker2:** Okay, so like, it turns out that using pseudo-labels can be really effective in certain contexts. And also, some of the... uh, threshold values we found to work really well.

**speaker1:** That's cool! I mean, it's not exactly a shocker, but still, it's interesting stuff!

**speaker2:** (laughs) Yeah, maybe not that surprising, but still, it's worth exploring further. And maybe next time... (pauses)

**speaker1:** (interrupting) Next time? Like, what do you have planned?

**speaker2:** (laughs) Well, I was thinking of talking about some potential applications for pseudo-labels in real-world scenarios. Like, um, medical diagnosis or something.

**speaker1:** That sounds like a great topic! Let's make sure to... (pauses)

**speaker2:** (laughing) Yeah, let's do that!

(both laugh and the conversation continues...)
