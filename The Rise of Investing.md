Speaker 1: So, I've been reading about this entrepreneur who's making waves in the investment world. She's an angel investor with over a million followers on social media and has invested in over 70 companies.

Speaker 2: That sounds impressive. What's her story? How did she get into investing?

Speaker 1: Well, from what I've read, she started out as a wellness content creator and author, and then founded her own health and beauty marketplace called HBFIT. She had to close the company after eight years in business.

Speaker 2: Yeah, that's tough. What did she learn from that experience?

Speaker 1: Apparently, she learned how to handle co-founder fallouts, which is something that can be really difficult when you're running a business. And she also emphasized the importance of community and networking - like, how important it is to lean on your network for advice or just to connect with people.

Speaker 2: That makes sense. So, has her experience as a founder influenced her approach to investing?

Speaker 1: Definitely. She's been advising and mentoring founders, which led to writing angel checks to their companies. And then she started growing an investment empire, both from angel investing and from receiving equity in brands she worked with as a content creator.

Speaker 2: Wow, that's a lot of experience under her belt. How does she think the lack of diversity in investors is affecting the industry?

Speaker 1: Well, she pointed out that less than 5% of investors are Black, which is a pretty low percentage. And even though efforts are being made to make it more transparent and accessible, there's still this perception that investing is only for wealthy people with high net worth.

Speaker 2: That's true. It can be really intimidating for people who want to invest but don't know where to start.

Speaker 1: Yeah, which is why she wants to focus on overlooked founders who often get dismal and dwindling amounts of venture funding. She's trying to fill that gap by investing in companies that need it most.

Speaker 2: That's really admirable. What advice does she have for people who want to start investing but don't know where to begin?

Speaker 1: Like, she said, you should just start having conversations with people in your network - maybe they're investors, maybe they're not, but they might be able to introduce you to someone who is. And also, don't be afraid to cold-email people or reach out for a casual conversation that's not necessarily about money.

Speaker 2: That makes sense. It's all about building relationships and being comfortable investing in yourself first.

Speaker 1: Exactly. She also mentioned that she wants to become more than just an angel investor - she wants to be an institutional investor, which would allow her to make bigger investments and potentially build a holding company for Black-owned brands.

Speaker 2: That's a big goal. Do you think it's feasible?

Speaker 1: Well, she said she's been raising special purpose vehicles to get in on larger check rounds, and that sparked this idea of launching her own fund. So yeah, I think it's definitely possible - but it will take some hard work and dedication.

Speaker 2: Absolutely. It sounds like she's passionate about creating a more inclusive investment industry, which is something we can all get behind.

Speaker 1: Yeah, totally.
