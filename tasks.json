{"type": "text", "content": "Alright, so moving on, um, I wanted to discuss a book I've been reading. It's called, uh, \"The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck\" by Mark Manson. Uh, it's been really eye-opening for me. The way he, uh, talks about embracing challenges and, um, finding meaning in life's struggles is, uh, pretty compelling.\n\nYou know, sometimes we get so caught up in, uh, trying to avoid discomfort that we, uh, miss out on opportunities for growth. Um, it's made me rethink how I approach obstacles in my own life.\n\nSo, yeah, if you're looking for a good read, I'd, uh, definitely recommend checking it out. Um, alright, I think that's all for today.", "tts_engine": "piper"}
